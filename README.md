  # Social Network API

  # Description
  In this module assignment, we learn about the use of MongoDB and its performance for social networks. MongoDB is proficientin spead with its speed when dealing with large amounts of data and its adaptability to unstructured data. I was taked with building a social web application that allows users to post and react to thoughts, along with interacting with other users through adding them to a friend list and and creating particular friend lists.

  I struggled immensely with this assignment however to the mongoose usage of storying data and reading the code in general. I plan on revisiting this assignment in the near future.
